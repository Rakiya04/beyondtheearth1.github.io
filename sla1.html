                <h4>Toque Macaque</h4>
                <p>This little macaque has golden-brown fur and is a native of Sri Lanka. Toque Macaque is referred to as the "Rilawa" by the locals. The toque-like swirl of hair on the top of this primate's head is its most defining characteristic. Actually, depending on the climate, their physiological traits differ significantly. As a result, populations living in colder climates have thicker, dark brown coats and shorter tails and limbs. In contrast, animals that live in lowland rainforests usually have longer bonnets and reddish or golden fur. Populations found in drier environments have shorter hair swirls on their heads, lighter fur, and noticeably longer legs and tails.</p>

                <h4>Sloth Bear</h4>
                <p class="p2">The Indian subcontinent is home to the myrmecophagous sloth bear (Melursus ursinus). The primary reasons for its vulnerable status on the IUCN Red List are habitat loss and degradation. Sloth bears occasionally attack humans who encroach on their territories. Historically, hunting bears for food and products like their bacula and claws has severely reduced the habitat of these bears and decreased their population. Sloth bears have been domesticated and kept as pets and performers.</p>

                <h4>Sri Lankan Blue magpie</h4>
                <p>The brightly coloured Ceylon magpie, also known as the Sri Lanka blue magpie (Urocissa ornata), is a member of the Corvidae family that is unique to Sri Lanka. This species is extremely active and nimble because it is adapted to hunting in the dense canopy. However, it is rarely used for long-distance flying due to its weak flight. The Sri Lanka blue magpie is categorised as vulnerable to extinction because of the fragmentation and destruction of its habitat, which is dense primary forest in the wet zone of southern Sri Lanka, despite its ability to adapt to human presence.</p>

                <h4>Purple-faced langur</h4>
                <p class="p2">The purple-faced leaf monkey, or purple-faced langur (Semnopithecus vetulus), is an Old World monkey species that is unique to Sri Lanka. It is a long-tailed arboreal species that is primarily brown in colour, has a dark face (with a paler lower face), and is extremely shy. The species was formerly quite common, found in the "wet zone" villages and suburban areas of Colombo (areas with year-round high temperatures and high humidity, along with monsoon rainstorms). However, rapid urbanisation has resulted in a significant decline in the monkey population. </p>

                <h4>Grizzled giant squirrel </h4>
                <p class="p2">The grizzled giant squirrel, or Ratufa macroura, is a large tree squirrel belonging to the genus Ratufa. It can be found in the hill forests of southern India's Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala states, as well as in the highlands of Sri Lanka's Central and Uva provinces. It can also be found in patches of riparian forest along the Kaveri River. Because of habitat loss and hunting, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the species as near threatened. </p>
