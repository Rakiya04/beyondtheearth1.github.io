            <h1>Yala National Park</h1>
            <p>Yala National Park is the place to go for leopaard sightings. This five-block park is billed by the Ministry of Lands and Tourism as the best place to see leopards in the wild. When wondering where to see leopards in Sri Lanka, visitors frequently inquire, "How many leopards are there in Yala National Park?" With an estimated 60 to 70 leopards dispersed throughout the park, it is the world's most popular tourist destination with the highest density of leopards. However, there is no assurance that your visit will include seeing a leopard because the park is 979 square kilometres in size. Positively, it increases the likelihood that you will eventually find them.</p>

            <p>The island's far eastern corner is home to Kumana, the land of mystery and wonder.Initially, Kumana gained notoriety as a bird sanctuary, home to numerous species of birds that nested in Kumana Villu's waters. However, over the past ten or so years, the park has seen an increase in the number of leopard sightings. According to legend, the leopards of Kumana are infamous for being "man-eaters," while the leopards of Lenama, a park area, are said to be larger and more deadly. However, these two are actually the same leopards that you see in Yala. However, there have been more reports of man-eaters in this park than in many other areas of the island.</p>

            <h1>Horton Plains National Park</h1>
            <p>Horton Plains National Park is one of the last remaining highland wilderness refuges. One of Mother Nature's most breathtaking marvels, this montane wilderness is perched atop a high plateau at an elevation of more than 2500 metres above sea level.With perseverance and innumerable visits over the past few years, this has also resulted in some incredible leopard encounters.The most important landscapes of this habitat are the deep, dense cloud forests and the edges of the open plains, which are home to these predators, who rule this domain.With their diet consisting mostly of Sambhur, the largest deer species in Sri Lanka, these cats appear to differ physiologically from their cousins in the lowlands.

            <p>The Sri Lankan leopard population is threatened by climate change. The main challenges they face due to climate change are prolonged droughts, temperature rise, disruptions in reproduction, and habitat loss. To reduce the threat faced by Sri Lankan leopards, the Sri Lankan government has implemented several conservation programs to protect the species, including the establishment of a national leopard conservation center. The center aims to promote research, education, and conservation of the Sri Lankan leopard. In addition, the Sri Lankan government has also implemented several laws and regulations to protect the species from illegal hunting and habitat destruction.(Groundviews, 2022)</p>

            <img src="/img/leopard4.jpeg" alt="Threat 2">
            <p>The Sri Lankan leopard is a vulnerable subspecies of leopard native to Sri Lanka. The primary threats to their survival are habitat loss and fragmentation and human-induced mortality. The Sri Lankan leopard population is estimated to be less than 800 mature individuals and is probably declining. Illegal hunting and habitat destruction are the main reasons for the decline in the population of Sri Lankan leopards.<br><br>
                To reduce the threat faced by Sri Lankan leopards, several mechanisms have been implemented. The Department of Wildlife Conservation in Sri Lanka has established several national parks and reserves to protect the natural habitats of these leopards. The Sri Lankan government has also implemented several conservation programs to protect the species, including the establishment of a national leopard conservation center. The center aims to promote research, education, and conservation of the Sri Lankan leopard. In addition, the Sri Lankan government has also implemented several laws and regulations to protect the species from illegal hunting and habitat destruction.(Australian Geographic, 2013)</p>
